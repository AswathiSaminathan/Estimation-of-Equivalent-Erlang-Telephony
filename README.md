# Estimation-of-Equivalent-Erlang-Telephony
Erlang formulas are generally applicable for circuit switched networks. In general, Erlang-B formulas deals with data loss in relation with the traffic load. This work is concerning the modelling of the regular IP traffic into Equivalent Erlang traffic and the applicability of the loss formula for the IP traffic. In the real world, IP networks are asynchronous in nature. Thereby, there is possibility of utilising Erlang formulas for asynchronous networks based on the common properties of the synchronous and asynchronous networks. The traffic of the asynchronous network is defined using loss, link utilisation and bandwidth. The results for these parameters are obtained using MATLAB that depicts the dependency between each parameter. In addition, an online Erlang calculator that uses the Westbay traffic estimator, which has capabilities of varying link characteristics that includes codec and network link that are used. The output of the simulated and the experimental results fitted against probability of packet loss and traffic load Erlangs are plotted
